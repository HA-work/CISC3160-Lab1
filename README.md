# Lab 1

This is the repository for CICS 3160 Lab 1.

For this lab I attempted 5 problems.
I used 4 different progamming languages.
The languages were C++, Java, Python and Java Script.

The programms are seperated into files based on the name of the language used.

The 5 programs are

1) A C++ program that creates a schedule to maximize the number of activities selected based on a greedy criterion of select activities that end earliest.
2) A Java program that reads in data from a CSV file about songs and outputs the number of times each artist appears and their total views.
3) A Python program that combines selection sort with tournaments to try and make a more efficient sort and compares it to regular selection sort.
4) A Python program that solves the Farmer, fox, goose and grain problem.
5) A Java Script program that asks for a type of recyclable and New York City zipcode and outputs dropoff locations.
